<p>Your instructor just gave your class the prompts for your first essay, which is due in two weeks. How do you proceed from here?</p>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q1" value="3" id="q1-a" class="a"><label for="q1-a">Choose a prompt and begin working on a thesis immediately. Better to get it out of the way!</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q1" value="2" id="q1-b" class="b"><label for="q1-b">Read over the prompts and let them sink in for a week or so. You'll still have one more week to finish the assignment, right?</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q1" value="1" id="q1-c" class="c"><label for="q1-c">Read the prompts and maybe start playing around with ideas, but wait to really start writing until the day before. You swear it's all in your head somewhere!</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q1" value="0" id="q1-d" class="d"><label for="q1-d">Depends on how much work you have for your other classes. But you might forget about it until a few hours before the assignment is due, and ask for an extension. </label></span>

      <fieldset class="f2">
<p>You are working on a group assignment that requires you to split up responsibilities with 3 other classmates. When would you typically finish your part?</p>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q2" value="3" id="q2-a" class="a"><label for="q2-a">First. Then you're done and don't have to worry about it. Plus it could give you time in case you want to tweak anything later.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q2" value="2" id="q2-b" class="b"><label for="q2-b">After one or two of the others have submitted their materials to the group, but definitely not last. You wanted to see how they approached it first.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q2" value="1" id="q2-c" class="c"><label for="q2-c">Maybe last, but definitely before the assignment due date and hopefully before any of the other group members ask about it.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q2" value="0" id="q2-d" class="d"><label for="q2-d">Definitely last. You'll wait until everyone else has done their work, so you can make sure you are not duplicating efforts. Whatever, this is why you hate group work. </label></span>

      <fieldset class="f3">
<p>Your instructor just posted the instructions for your next assignment and you read them but don't quite understand what he's asking for in a certain part. What would you probably do?</p>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q3" value="3" id="q3-a" class="a"><label for="q3-a">Send him an email that afternoon. When he doesn't respond that night, email him again. This is your worst nightmare—you just want to know what he wants!!</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q3" value="2" id="q3-b" class="b"><label for="q3-b">Send him an email asking for clarification, giving yourself enough time to wait for his response and then complete the assignment. Better to be safe than sorry.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q3" value="1" id="q3-c" class="c"><label for="q3-c">Try to figure it out for yourself. You're pretty sure what he's trying to say, and you'll give it your best shot.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q3" value="0" id="q3-d" class="d"><label for="q3-d">Don't say anything until after the assignment is due. Other people in the class felt the same way too, probably!</label></span>
</fieldset>
      <fieldset class="f4">
<p>The course you are taking requires you to post on a weekly discussion forum by Sunday night each week so the class can talk about everyone's posts on Monday. When do you submit your posts?</p>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q4" value="3" id="q4-a" class="a"><label for="q4-a">Tuesday night, after the first day of class that week. Then it's out of the way.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q4" value="2" id="q4-b" class="b"><label for="q4-b">Thursday or Friday night. You want to let the week's discussion sink in a little so you can collect your thoughts. </label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q4" value="1" id="q4-c" class="c"><label for="q4-c">Sunday night. You always forget during the weekend!</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q4" value="0" id="q4-d" class="d"><label for="q4-d">Monday at 3 AM. That still counts as Sunday night, right?</label></span>

      <fieldset class="f5">
<p>You have an important assignment due Monday morning, and you have a social/work/family obligation that will keep you busy for most of the weekend. It is now the Wednesday before the assignment is due. How would you approach this dilemma?</p>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q5" value="3" id="q5-a" class="a"><label for="q5-a"> You already finished it yesterday, the day it was assigned. Done!</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q5" value="2" id="q5-b" class="b"><label for="q5-b">You tell yourself that you'll finish it by Friday night, and you manage this by chipping away at it over those 3 days. …Little. By. Little.(between 4-8 years).</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q5" value="1" id="q5-c" class="c"><label for="q5-c">You tell yourself that you'll finish it by Friday night, so you can have your weekend free, but you still have a little left to do on Sunday—no big deal.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q5" value="0" id="q5-d" class="d"><label for="q5-d">You tell yourself that you'll take the weekend off, then stay up late on Sunday or wake up early on Monday to finish it. It's not a final or anything, and you have a life.</label></span>

      <fieldset class="f6">
<p>You have to read 150 pages before your next class meeting. You have 4 days to do so. What would you most likely do?</p>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q6" value="3" id="q6-a" class="a"><label for="q6-a">150 pages divided by 4 days means... a little less than 40 pages a day. You like to chunk it this way because then you'll also have time to go over your notes and highlights, and come up with questions for the instructor.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q6" value="2" id="q6-b" class="b"><label for="q6-b">150 pages divided by... well, ... 2 days (because it's been a long week), means 75 pages a day. Totally doable.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q6" value="1" id="q6-c" class="c"><label for="q6-c">150 pages, the day before it is due. You did this to yourself, it's fine.</label></span><br>
<span class="selectans"><input type="radio" name="q6" value="0" id="q6-d" class="d"><label for="q6-d">How much time does it take to skim the text for key words and/or find a summary online? </label></span>
